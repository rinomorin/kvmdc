KVM Console Manage
I'm Starting new project,  for managin KVM, I like proximov, but i alway end up working form consol. since on mini server, it can't do what i and do to hardware limitae, such as 1 NIC. 
Pluse i feel it's missing item and well as i would like to try to implement a more robust gui configure process. 

So this is my first attemnpt. 

Writting in Python, React using a Mongo db as back end. 

Will keep detail as we go foward. 

Below is diagram of initial plan.
